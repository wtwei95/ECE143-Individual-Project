    "Each rectangle area is represented as a binary 2d-array, those area covered by towers are filled with 1 and remaining area are filled with 0. The key problem is how to trim a newly added rectangle area to maximize the remaining area. I use a very efficient dynamic programming algorithm to solve this key problem. The main idea is to find the largest rectangle in a binary matrix, and this problem can be transformed to a sub-problem which is to find the largest rectangle in histogram. "

    "## Trade-offs\n",
    "At first, I thought of two ways to represent a rectangle. The first one is using a binary 2d-array to represent a rectangle area. The second one is using the coordinate of two diagonal vertex. For visualization, the second representation is better to draw a rectangle using patches.Rectangle. But I decided to choose the first representation, because this is more efficient in the trimming process. Although it's harder to visualize (transformation funciton required), it accelerates the algorithm a lot. it's worthwhile to do the trade-offs. "

    "## Limitations\n",
    "When computing the average number of communications towers are required before full coverage is obtained, I increment the number by 1 after each try until the full coverage is obtained. This process is guaranteed to find the smallest number of communications towers required but it's a little bit slow when the whole area is very large."

    "The insights of my solution are effectively designed the trimming algorithm. How to trim a new tower’s coverage such that its maximum remaining coverage area is retained is the most important problem. After dividing this problem into several subproblem, I transformed this problem to find the largest rectangle in histogram. By using dynamic programming ideas, I successfully solved this problem."
